This is a project from the Hyperskill Java Developer Course called Learning Progress Tracker. I created different objects for Student, Course, and Notification.

It's my first Gradle project and my first experience with unit testing. The code itself could definetly benefit from some additional refactoring.
I'm still figuring out how to use these tools, and I ended up not writing all the tests that I planned to write. However, now I finally understand how Test Driven Development can be useful.
